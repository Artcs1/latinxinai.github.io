bio: I have been working as a linguist in computer science for more than 20 years, of which the first 6 in Barcelona and the rest in CÃ³rdoba, a city in the non-Buenos Aires part of Argentina. I am interested in context-aware, low resource computational linguistics, in particular - how do we manage world-class research in a low-income country? how do we teach long-term vision and strong foundations in a context that rewards immediate success? how do we obtain valuable results with small(ish) computers and little data? I have been struggling with those questions within research projects involving various countries in South America and Europe.
