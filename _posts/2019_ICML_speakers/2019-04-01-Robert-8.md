bio: 'I am a researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Research Group of the
Pontifical Catholic University of Peru, where I finished my bachelors in
Informatics Engineering with one year of abroad studies at the University of
SÃ£o Paulo in Brazil and the University of Calgary in Canada. I have been
working on research projects covering neural machine translation, hierarchical
text classification, recommender systems and representation learning for
meta-learning, generative models and image segmentation, while also working as
a part-time R&D engineer at a startup (Karaoke Smart) and as a teaching
assistant at my university. Besides, I enjoy participating in data science
competitions (and previously ACM ICPC programming competitions), being the
winner of the Data Talent Movistar competition and finalist of the Data Science
Game 2018 in Paris, France.'
