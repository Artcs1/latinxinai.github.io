bio: For centuries, the way that humans modify their bodies  varies from cultural aspects such as in rituals and ceremonies, to camouflage when hunting or fighting, but mostly for augmenting and hiding our physical features in order to enhance appearance. In order to move forward body modification techniques to interactive ones, Katia Vega created Beauty Technology. It extends the functionality of cosmetics by exploring them as skin interfaces such as Conductive Makeup, Tech Nails and Hairware. The Dermal Abyss explores the possibilities of replacing traditional tattoo ink with biosensors that changes colors in response to changes in our metabolism. In this way, the skin is a bio-display that reveals information that is inside the body such as pH, sodium and glucose levels. Katia Vega is an Assistant Professor at the Department of Design in the University of California, Davis. She was a Postdoc Associate at MIT Media Lab (USA). She got her PhD and Master Degree in Computer Science at PUC-Rio (Brazil). Her research interests include wearable technologies, interactive tattoos, beauty technology and skin interfaces. Her work has been featured by New Scientist, Wired, Discovery, CNN, among others. In 2016, MIT Technology Review awarded her as one of the 5 Innovators under 35  in Peru. Recently, CNET recognized her as one of the Top 20 most influential Latinos in Tech in 2017. SXSW 2018 awarded The Dermal Abyss project in the Science Fiction no Longer Category. In 2019, she was honored as a leading woman in STEM by Johnson & Johnson.
