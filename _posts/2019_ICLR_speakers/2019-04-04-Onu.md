topic: Neural Transfer Learning for Cry-based Diagnosis of Perinatal Asphyxia
bio: Charles is a PhD student at McGill University's School of Computer Science. He is advised by Professor Doina Precup. His research interest lies in the development of improved, cost-effective diagnostic and decision making tools in healthcare. He leads the Ubenwa project, a collaboration between researchers in Canada and Nigeria, applying machine learning for low-cost detection of perinatal asphyxia from the infant cry. Charles obtained a master's degree in computer science from McGill. During this time, he was involved in the APEX project developing machine learning methods for analyzing cardiorespiratory behaviour of preterm newborns. He also worked with Health Experiences Research Canada for 2 years, contributing to the design and leading the development of the a personalized recommendation tool for breast cancer patients.  Prior to that, he worked for 3 years as a software engineer at Cypher Crescent after obtaining a bachelor's degree in Electrical/Electronics Engineering at the Federal University of Technology, Owerri, Nigeria.
