bio: Adji Bousso Dieng is a PhD candidate in the Statistics Department at Columbia University. She is jointly advised by David Blei and John Paisley. Her research focuses on combining probabilistic graphical modeling and deep learning to design models that are flexible and expressive enough to capture meaningful representations of high dimensional structured data such as text. She also works on developing inference methods for learning effectively with these models. Prior to joining Columbia, Adji worked as a Junior Professional Associate at the World Bank. She did her undergraduate training in France where she attended Lycee Henri IV and Telecom ParisTech--France's Grandes Ecoles system. Adji holds a Diplome d'Ingenieur from Telecom ParisTech and spent the third year of Telecom ParisTech's curriculum at Cornell University where she earned a Master in Statistics.
