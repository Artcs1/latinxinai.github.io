bio: I was born and raised in the small, agricultural town of Delano, California. I went on to earn my B.A. in Mathematics from California State University, Fresno (Fresno State) and I obtained my Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics from the University of California, Merced under the guidance of my advisor Prof. Suzanne Sindi. I am currently an Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Fresno State. My research interests include mathematical biology, optimization, statistical models for genome evolution, and data science. Most data I consider in my work is low quality or corrupted by noise, and I am working on developing and applying machine learning methods for arbitrary architectures with applications in signal reconstruction. Instead of relying on high quality and often expensive data to improve results, I am applying these machine learning models to a multitude of low-quality biological (e.g., genomics) data of related individuals or species.
