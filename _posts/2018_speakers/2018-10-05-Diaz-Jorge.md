topic: Support Fuzzy-Set Machines - From Kernels on Fuzzy Sets to Machine Learning Applications
bio: I am Research Scientist at IBM Research, I actively perform research in Artificial Intelligence for solving and giving smart data-driven solutions to problems arisen from oil and gas companies and, for applying Machine Learning and Data Science solutions on the Natural Resources area. I am very interested in the study of Artificial Intelligence, from theoretical to practice perspective, nowadays, I am investigating on how we can make AI more explainable and interpretable, and how industry and society can benefit from this. I hold a Ph.D., an MSc, and a BSc in Computer Science. My areas of interest are Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep Learning, Speech Recognition, Signal Processing and Statistical Learning Theory. In the past, I worked on Kernel Methods, Fuzzy Theory and Speech Recognition.
