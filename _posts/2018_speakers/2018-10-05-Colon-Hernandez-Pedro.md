bio: Pedro is a Ph.D. student at the MIT Media Lab.  Pedro was born and raised in Puerto Rico where he did his undergrad in Computer Engineering at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez. Pedro opted to do graduate studies to develop intelligent agents that can guide people along when they are using technology (i.e. addressing the problem of when your parents ask you how to do something on their phone because they don’t know how).  For his Master’s degree, he worked on wearable technology, developing a bracelet to identify objects and give you back contextual information from them.  The idea was to scan technological items and an agent would give you back usability for them, however the more general usage was to access augmented reality without the hassle of phones or head mounted devices.  Now Pedro is working on developing agents that can dynamically gather information on a topic and make inferences from it to automate the process of finding answers to questions.
