bio: Javier Sánchez Galán received his BSc. degree in Computer Systems Engineering at the Universidad Tecnologica de Panama (UTP) in 2006. In 2007 he was awarded a full scholarship from the Panamanian government (IFARHU-SENACYT) to pursue postgraduate studies at McGill University, in Montreal, Canada. In 2010, he completed his MSc. in Computer Science (Bioinformatics) at the McGill Centre for Bioinformatics, under the supervision of Prof. Mathieu Blanchette, in the area of Genomics and Computational Gene Regulation. In 2015 he finished his Ph.D. in Experimental Medicine at McGill’s Faculty of Medicine, where he worked under the supervision of Professor’s David Burns (Chemistry) and Kris Koski (School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition). This research effort focused on investigating various statistical and computational approaches for the discovery of candidate spectral regions relating maternal-fetal health aspects to biological fluids analyzed using Near-Infrared spectroscopy. Since 2013, he works as a Research Scientist at the UTP in the Production Center Agroindustrial Research, where he is a coordinator of the Research Group in Biotechnology, Bioinformatics and Systems/Synthetic Biology (GIBBS). He, also works as a Professor in the Department of Computer Systems Engineering at UTP at the graduate and undergraduate levels. Since February 2015, he also works as an adjunct researcher at Institute of Scientific Research and High Technology Services (INDICASAT-AIP). His research interests are focused on the development of innovative approaches applying computational data analysis of massive datasets coming from biological, medical, environmental and agricultural fields.
