bio: Pablo is a computer scientist and deep learning evangelist. He is a professional member of the ACM and a senior member of the IEEE. His degrees are in computer science (B.S. '03), electrical engineering (M.S. '07), and electrical and computer engineering (Ph.D. '11 from the University of Texas at El Paso). Currently, he is an Assistant Professor of Computer Science at Marist College. Before that, he was a Postdoc at Baylor University and a NASA intern. At Marist he teaches machine learning-related courses and software engineering-related courses and investigates the efficiency and accuracy of deep learning models. While at Baylor he worked on a deep learning projects for the detection of leukocoria [see leuko.net for more info], which is based on deep convolutional networks and other image-processing techniques. While he was at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center he worked in the detection of very specific kinds of atmospheric particles using statistical and machine learning methods. Among his peers, he is recognized for his creativity and academic excellence and thus inducted to the International Honor Society Eta Kappa Nu (HKN). When he is not doing research or teaching, he likes to play basketball, and watch a good movie with his wife.  Dr. Rivas prefers spaces over tabs and Vim over Emacs, and is known to be judgmental of people who do otherwise.
