topic: Characterizing the COVID-19 epidemic using natural language processing and machine learning applied on a large-scale Twitter chatter dataset 
bio: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues its march around the world, an unprecedented amount of open data is being generated for genetics and epidemiological research. The unparalleled rate at which many research groups around the world are releasing data and publications on the ongoing pandemic is allowing other scientists to learn from local experiences and data generated at the front lines of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a need to integrate additional data sources that map and measure the role of social dynamics of such a unique world-wide event into biomedical, biological, and epidemiological analyses. While many groups are actively working on social media data, only a handful have released their data for public good. Turning the traditional research paradigm on its head, we publicly released all our collected COVID-19 Twitter chatter data since day one, while updating and growing this public resource every couple of days. In this talk I will show how we have been using natural language processing and machine learning to characterize self-reported symptoms, identify trending conversations around potential and anecdotal drug treatments, measure the sentiment of discussions with respect to elderly populations and under-represented minorities. With these and other topics, you will get a peek at this work in progress and at the possibilities in work with social media data during these difficult and confusing times.
