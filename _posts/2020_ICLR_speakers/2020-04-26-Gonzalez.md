topic: Towards High-performance Surrogate-robotics - Teleoperation for Mission-critical Tasks
bio: Bidirectionally connecting humans and robots enables the remotely distributed realization of high-value complex tasks. The reliability of such far-off perception-action link depends not only on the communication technologies but also on the representation effectiveness employed to capture and describe the environment while triggering robot actions. A framework enabling humans to exploit remote located robots executing mission-critical tasks should balance performance with resources in a time-varying and situation-aware manner. Within this context, our early results on 4D Space-time Representation for Active Perception and Wireless Time-sensitive Networking over Wi-Fi6 are described in a concrete low-latency human-robot imitation setup. This initial insights suggest application feasibility while exposing challenges on the system-codesign.
