      <h2>Mission</h2>
      <p>Our mission is to increase representation of our communities at the main conference and create a platform allowing our members to share their work, gain access to mentoring, collaborations, and networking opportunities with other researchers in artificial intelligence. </p>
      
      <p>During the official LatinX in AI virtual gathering at the International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR) 2020 we will highlight efforts by our community members and institutions using AI in response to the COVID-19 Virus Pandemic. The individuals involved in these efforts can be located anywhere in the world, but at least one member must primarily self-identify as LatinX.</p>
      <p><strong>If you would like to nominate yourself, an institution or member of the community for recognition, please do so here: <a target="_blank" href='https://forms.gle/FJrVrworKTBjxa2eA'>LXAI Community COVID-19 Highlight Nominations</a></strong></p>
