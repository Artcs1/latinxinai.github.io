  <h1>LatinX in AI Directory</h1>
  <p>We are creating a public directory of LatinX individuals active in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science. This directory will be maintained by the LatinX in AI (LXAI) organization.</p>
    <br>
    <p>If you are organizing an event related to artificial intelligence, this list serves as a resource for potential speakers.</p>

    <p>If you identify as latinx and are working in artificial intelligence or know someone who is latinx and is working in artificial intelligence, please fill in the information form to add someone to the directory (or update existing information).  This list is opt-in; if anyone is added (or any change is made) via the form, the person whose information is added will be contacted by email and must respond before they are added publicly. Please note that there may be some delay before the directory is updated.</p>
