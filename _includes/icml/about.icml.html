    <h2>Call for Participation</h2>
    <p>The workshop is a one-day event with invited speakers, oral
    presentations, and posters. The event brings together faculty, graduate
    students, research scientists, and engineers for an opportunity to connect
    and exchange ideas. There will be a panel discussion and a mentoring
    session to discuss current research trends and career choices in artificial
    intelligence and machine learning. While all presenters will identify
    primarily as latinx, all are invited to attend.</p>

      <h2>Submission Instructions</h2>
      <p>We strongly encourage students, post-docs and researchers who
      primarily identify as latinx in all areas of machine learning to submit
      an abstract describing new, previously, or concurrently published
      research. We welcome abstract submissions, in theory, methodology, as
      well as applications. Abstracts may describe completed research or
      work-in-progress. While the presenting author need not be the first
      author of the work, we encourage authors to highlight the contribution
      of latinx individuals — particularly the presenting author — in the
      abstract.</p>
      <p>Authors of accepted abstracts will be asked to present their work in
      a poster session. A few authors will be selected to give 15 minute oral
      presentations.  Submissions will be peer-reviewed.  Authors are
      encouraged to sign up to review for LXAI, with a sign-up option
      available upon submission.</p>

      <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>
      <p>Submissions may be up to two pages including all figures and tables,
      with an additional page for references submitted as a link to a PDF.
      The submissions should be in a single column. They should be typeset
      using 11-point or larger fonts and should have at least 1-inch margin
      all around. Submissions that do not follow these guidelines risk being
      rejected without consideration of their merits. Submissions must state
      the research problem, motivation, and technical contribution.
      Submissions must be self-contained and include all figures, tables, and
      references.</p>
      <p>The submission deadline is <strong>11:59 PM (PST), March 4,
      2019</strong>. Please note that no extensions will be offered for
      submissions.</p>
