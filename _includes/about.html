      <p>The LatinX in AI Coalition (LXAI) bridges communities, academics, industry, and politicians working to further AI innovation and resources for LatinX individuals globally. We host research workshops at AI academic conferences, drive and support research, development, and infrastructure programs to boost innovation and capabilities of Latin Americans working in Artificial Intelligence. </p>
      <h3>Tenents</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase representation of Latinx in Artificial Intelligence</li>
      <li>Improve access to education and resources in AI engineering</li>
      <li>Improve awareness of the long and short term effects of artificial intelligence</li>
      <li>Increase communication between companies and LatinX AI engineers and researchers</li>
      <li>Ensure transparency and accuracy of latinx culture and voice in data representations</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Why Now?</h2>
    <P>Launched in January 2018, three Latinx individuals from organizations including the Accel AI Institute, Latino Startup Alliance and Accenture banded together to create a group that would be focused on “Creating Opportunity for LatinX in AI.”</p> 
      
    <p>Artificial Intelligence has the potential to displace workers of marginalized populations including those of Latinx origin. AI is already perpetuating social bias and prejudice because it lacks representation of LatinX professionals in the AI industry.

        <h3> Service Workers</h3>
        <p>The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that Latinas—those of Hispanic origin, experience one of the largest gender wage gaps among all women, earning less, on average, than white; black; Asian; Pacific Islander or Native Hawaiian; and American Indian or Alaska Native women. While white, non-Hispanic women earn around 79 percent of the annual salary of white men who work full-time, <strong>Latinas working full-time, year-round make only 54 percent of white men’s annual earnings.</strong></p>

        <p>Latinas are more likely to work in occupations that pay less, with one in three employed in service occupations. Median weekly earnings in service occupations represent less than half of the earnings
          of workers in management, professional, and related occupations.</p>
        
          <p>Automation and AI will reduce the demand for these low skill, low wage service positions, forcing latinas to switch occupations or upgrade skills -- a greater challenge when you're already earning less than your peers.</p>

          <h3> Autonomous Trucks</h3>
          <p>Out of a population of 3.5 million truck drivers in the U.S. – 3.1 million of whom are commercial driver’s license (CDL) holders – some 38.75% are minorities according to data compiled by the American Trucking Associations (ATA).</p>

          <p>Hispanic men make up the 2nd largest demographic of the truck driver population at 14.6%, based on 2014 data. Motor carriers are embracing and increasing the diverse ethnicity of the current workforce to fill their gaps in employment.</p>

          <p>Sixty-five percent of the nation’s consumable goods are trucked to market. With full autonomy, operating costs would decline by about 45 percent, saving the US for-hire trucking industry between $85 billion and $125 billion. These efforts towards automation at every step in the supply chain logistics, while great for a companies bottom-line, will force hispanic men to switch occupations or upgrade skills</p>
          
          <p><strong>It's imperative to ensure our community has a voice in the oncoming Autonomous Trucking revolution.</strong></p>
